# Welcome to My GitHub Profile üëã

Hello and thank you for visiting my profile! I'm a **B.Tech graduate in Information Technology** with a strong passion for **Mathematics** and **problem-solving**. Over time, I‚Äôve cultivated a deep interest in **data analysis**, which has driven me to explore various tools and techniques to uncover valuable insights from data. 

My journey into the world of data analysis was inspired by two key elements:

- **Mathematics**: A natural curiosity about numbers and patterns ignited my interest in analyzing data and applying logical reasoning to find solutions.
- **Business Acumen**: Growing up in a family business, I worked closely with my father, gaining first-hand experience in business operations. This allowed me to understand the importance of **data-driven decision-making** and how it can lead to **exponential business growth**.

### Key Skills & Tools

Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve developed hands-on experience with a variety of tools and techniques. Below are some of the key tools I‚Äôve worked with and the areas in which I specialize:

- üêç **Python**: Data extraction, manipulation, and automation using Python scripts.
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL**: Efficient querying and management of databases for data manipulation.
- üßÆ **Excel**: Advanced data analysis, cleaning, and modeling techniques.
- üìà **PowerBI**: Data visualization and storytelling through interactive and insightful dashboards.
- üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extracting trends and actionable insights from datasets.
- üìä **Dashboard Reporting**: Creating clear, concise, and actionable insights for business strategies.
- üåê **Google APIs**: Experience in fetching and analyzing data from Google APIs for real-time insights.

### Projects & Experience

I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on a variety of real-world projects, where I applied my skills to industry-specific problems. Here are three key projects that I am especially proud of:

1. **Zepto Sales Analysis**  
   Analyzed sales data from Zepto to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics that can drive business decisions.

2. **Pizza Hut Sales Analysis**  
   Applied data analysis techniques to understand sales performance, customer preferences, and regional patterns.

3. **YouTube Channel Analysis**  
   Utilized the **YouTube API** to fetch channel data and perform an in-depth analysis **(EDA)** of growth trends, engagement metrics, and content performance. Also deduced correlations between all input features and concluded that total no. of videos and total subscriber count had maximum correlation with total number of views whereas Channel age had almost no relation to total no of views, or no of subscribers.
    

These projects helped me sharpen my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, while also teaching me how to integrate different tools in a real-world context to drive insights.
