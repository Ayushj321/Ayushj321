# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

Hello and thank you for visiting my profile! I'm a **B.Tech graduate in Information Technology** with a strong passion for **Mathematics** and **problem-solving**. Over time, I’ve cultivated a deep interest in **data analysis**, which has driven me to explore various tools and techniques to uncover valuable insights from data. 

My journey into the world of data analysis was inspired by two key elements:

- **Mathematics**: A natural curiosity about numbers and patterns ignited my interest in analyzing data and applying logical reasoning to find solutions.
- **Business Acumen**: Growing up in a family business, I worked closely with my father, gaining first-hand experience in business operations. This allowed me to understand the importance of **data-driven decision-making** and how it can lead to **exponential business growth**.

### Key Skills & Tools

Throughout my journey, I’ve developed hands-on experience with a variety of tools and techniques. Below are some of the key tools I’ve worked with and the areas in which I specialize:

- 🐍 **Python**: Data extraction, manipulation, and automation using Python scripts.
- 🗄️ **SQL**: Efficient querying and management of databases for data manipulation.
- 🧮 **Excel**: Advanced data analysis, cleaning, and modeling techniques.
- 📈 **PowerBI**: Data visualization and storytelling through interactive and insightful dashboards.

- 📊 **Dashboard Reporting**: Creating clear, concise, and actionable insights for business strategies.
- 🌐 **Google APIs**: Experience in fetching and analyzing data from Google APIs for real-time insights.
